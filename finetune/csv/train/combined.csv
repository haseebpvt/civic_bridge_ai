The meeting went really well.,1
It’s already been submitted.,1
I wasn’t sure how to respond when,0
"The thing is, I haven’t really",0
I'll check on that right away.,1
I told them it wouldn’t be a,0
"After I logged in, the screen just",0
Unless someone else wants to,0
"When I got the email, I was",0
He confirmed the appointment.,1
Everyone was happy with the outcome.,1
"I’m heading out now, see you soon.",1
This is what we agreed on.,1
Let’s wait until they,0
It’s scheduled for next Thursday.,1
We could probably try again if the,0
"By the time I noticed, it was already",0
"Once the results come in, we’ll",0
We talked about this last week.,1
This is exactly what we needed.,1
I’ve already signed the form.,1
It should be done by Friday.,1
He’s already on his way.,1
The results were better than expected.,1
We should try again once we,0
We could start earlier if there’s no,0
I think they were trying to,0
It's already been taken care of.,1
I’ll be online around three.,1
"When we get the confirmation, we’ll",0
He’ll send the report tonight.,1
Just a minute ago I thought I,0
"Before she arrived, we were going to",0
She told me they were going to,0
Thanks for bringing that up.,1
We need to update the chart after we,0
Let me just grab my laptop.,1
You know how sometimes they just,0
He asked me if I had a,0
I’ll have to reschedule because,0
He thought it might be useful to,0
She gave me a look like she,0
I talked to her about it but she,0
Let’s meet at the usual spot.,1
Just let me know the deadline.,1
"I guess we could, but only if",0
"If I had known earlier, I would’ve",0
Let me know what you decide.,1
"Before we decide, we should probably",0
They haven’t said whether they,0
"In case you’re wondering, I",0
I was planning to finish it but,0
It’s probably too late to,0
Let’s continue this tomorrow.,1
I'm not sure what time he,0
I was going to mention that if we,0
I think it’s worth exploring.,1
"Even if I wanted to, I couldn’t",0
It depends on whether they want to,0
I sent the document yesterday.,1
The presentation is almost done.,1
We’re going to launch next month.,1
That’s what I planned to do.,1
Thanks again for your help.,1
"After we’re done with the call, we could",0
It looks like we might need to rethink,0
Not unless you really think we,0
That's exactly what I was thinking.,1
We’ll wrap this up by noon.,1
They said yes to the proposal.,1
Don’t forget to send me the,0
We should get started after lunch.,1
"I got your message, thanks.",1
I’ll talk to you soon.,1
Let me double-check before I,0
I’m glad we talked this through.,1
Could you let me know where the,0
Everything looks good on my end.,1
She's going to join us later.,1
They’ll take care of it.,1
We’re supposed to hear back from,0
I'll be there in 15 minutes.,1
We finalized the details earlier.,1
I think he said it was under the,0
I’ve updated the spreadsheet.,1
Nothing else is pending right now.,1
The main thing to keep in mind is,0
Can you ask her when she,0
You should’ve seen the way he,0
"That reminds me, did you ever",0
"If you see him, tell him that",0
"Yes, it’s all in the folder.",1
The issue might be with the way we,0
Sounds like a good plan.,1
You can pick it up tomorrow.,1
That’s all I needed from you.,1
"Depending on how that goes, we can",0
We’ve got everything we need.,1
They might change it depending on what,0
We can start whenever you’re ready.,1
This seems ready for review.,1
I'll take care of the details.,1
I copied you on that email.,1
I don’t think he realized that,0
"Unless someone objects, we’ll",0
"Depending on how things go later, we could",0
I'll join the call in 5 minutes.,1
"Unless it’s urgent, I wouldn’t",0
Let’s move this to next week’s agenda.,1
They’ll probably do it once they,0
I was meaning to bring this up during the,0
I’ll be available until six.,1
They were happy with the proposal.,1
He sent it but forgot to include the,0
No changes are needed at this point.,1
We’ll finish the rest tomorrow.,1
They might change the date if they,0
Let’s see what she says before we,0
It’s already uploaded to the folder.,1
They might still be waiting for the,0
Just emailed it to you.,1
I'll upload the rest shortly.,1
We’re assuming the issue is with the,0
They agreed on the new schedule.,1
There’s a chance we might have to,0
You mentioned a plan but didn’t,0
We finalized the draft just now.,1
She had a suggestion about the,0
He never responded to the,0
I was wondering if we should maybe,0
He already gave his feedback.,1
"When I last checked, it still",0
Could you remind me where we,0
He told me it would probably,0
He was talking about the plan and then he,0
The deadline is still the same.,1
We didn’t plan for the possibility that,0
"Before we begin, I just want to",0
He will explain it during the meeting.,1
I think we’ve covered everything.,1
Let me circle back after I,0
That’s what I thought until I,0
The server crashed right after we,0
It was working earlier but now it,0
Everything's going according to plan.,1
We’ve made good progress today.,1
We didn’t hear back after we,0
This version looks cleaner.,1
We’ll follow up once we get the,0
"Once we’re back online, we can",0
"If she agrees, we can",0
I already checked the document.,1
I’ll start writing the report.,1
I asked him to send it but he,0
You might want to double-check the,0
That sounds like a fair approach.,1
Let's finalize the design by tomorrow.,1
She shared the link with everyone.,1
There’s a possibility we’ll need to,0
You can review it anytime.,1
Please approve it when you can.,1
That’s why I think we should,0
She's on her way to the office.,1
She added it to the calendar.,1
"Yes, let’s move forward with that.",1
Let’s decide after we review the,0
"Yes, that makes perfect sense.",1
I’ve been meaning to ask you if you,0
I guess we can talk about it when we,0
I’ll let you know if anything changes.,1
Let me check and get back to you.,1
We can take a short break now.,1
It's been added to the list.,1
I’ll try to finish it after I,0
I'll take the notes during the meeting.,1
He joined a few minutes ago.,1
Everything’s working fine now.,1
Let me know if you need help with that.,1
You could tell they weren’t ready to,0
There’s something I forgot to,0
Please send me the updated version.,1
We have to reschedule because the,0
We should hear back by Friday.,1
I wasn’t expecting that we’d need to,0
I couldn’t figure out how to fix the,0
They started but didn’t finish the,0
It’s been approved by the team.,1
She didn’t mention anything about the,0
It’s showing up correctly now.,1
"That’s all I needed, thanks.",1
We’re done for today.,1
"Before she left, she said that",0
You can go ahead and start.,1
They haven’t replied since they,0
We can skip it unless someone,0
They were supposed to let us know but,0
We might have to adjust if they,0
Let’s call it a day then.,1
"Thanks, that answers my question.",1
We can close this ticket now.,1
I was going to finish that later but,0
"Before we wrap up, I wanted to",0
Just confirmed the schedule.,1
Nothing else is needed from my end.,1
I think we were supposed to,0
You’ll need to verify it before you,0
I couldn’t log in because the,0
We didn’t have time to review the,0
He completed the update yesterday.,1
Shouldn’t be a problem unless we,0
If she doesn’t respond by tomorrow,0
There’s something off about the way it,0
Everything seems to be working.,1
She didn’t give any details about the,0
The team gave the green light.,1
I’m pretty sure it’s related to the,0
"After talking to him, I thought we",0
It looks like it passed all checks.,1
Everything is in place now.,1
Might be easier if we just,0
They said they’d let us know but,0
"Unless we hear otherwise, we’ll",0
Everything's synced and ready.,1
Let’s finalize it this afternoon.,1
He almost finished it but then he,0
We couldn’t figure out how to,0
Thanks for confirming that.,1
I’ve added it to the plan.,1
You might want to check with the,0
That wraps up our discussion.,1
The notes are clear and helpful.,1
I’ll take care of that after I,0
Just let me know what’s next.,1
All set from my side.,1
Let’s see if it changes once we,0
Let me ask him if he can,0
"Looks good, thanks for the update.",1
I wasn’t aware that they,0
Let’s go with this version.,1
It’s showing correctly on my screen.,1
I’m done with my part.,1
It was supposed to be included in the,0
I’d like to revisit that after we,0
"This looks great, nice work.",1
We could consider that option if the,0
We were waiting on the confirmation from,0
They approved the changes quickly.,1
It’s still waiting for the final,0
We can finalize this by Monday.,1
I was just about to reach out and,0
She was going to show us how to,0
You might not have access to the,0
I’ve added the changes you requested.,1
They’ve agreed to the new terms.,1
You did a fantastic job here.,1
"Yes, I’ve already updated that.",1
Just need to double-check the,0
This approach makes a lot of sense.,1
This should work just fine.,1
They’ll follow up after they,0
That solves the problem we had.,1
Let’s wait a bit longer before we,0
The update was successful.,1
We can skip it unless they,0
He might still be reviewing the,0
"If it doesn’t work, we can always",0
We’ve completed the final review.,1
She mentioned it briefly during the,0
They’ve already started working on the,0
She joined the call just now.,1
He reviewed it yesterday.,1
This matches the requirements perfectly.,1
We’re missing the details from the,0
Could be useful if we also,0
He’ll tell us more when he,0
We were thinking about switching to a,0
He didn’t explain what he meant by,0
We're aligned on this now.,1
She's already working on it.,1
I'll mark it as complete.,1
"If that’s the case, then maybe we",0
I've forwarded it to the team.,1
You should see it once you,0
We're good to go.,1
There’s no way to know until we,0
"Once we hear back, we can",0
We’ll review it again tomorrow.,1
We can archive it now.,1
I think we’ve resolved the issue.,1
We didn’t check the status of the,0
He submitted the form this morning.,1
I think we're ready to proceed.,1
He explained everything clearly.,1
Let me close this ticket now.,1
They’ve signed off on it.,1
The issue was supposed to be resolved by,0
That version was more accurate.,1
You can submit it whenever.,1
"Before I forget, I wanted to",0
I'll send a reminder later.,1
I’ll prepare a summary slide.,1
He's supposed to send it before the,0
We might want to recheck the way it,0
I uploaded it to the shared folder.,1
We haven’t received the confirmation for the,0
We missed that step when we,0
She’s going to follow up with the,0
It’s been pushed to production.,1
I'll send the invitation shortly.,1
That should be added once we,0
I believe that wraps it up.,1
No issues from my end.,1
That’s all I had to share.,1
Let me ping him again to see if,0
We might run into issues unless we,0
We’ll present the results tomorrow.,1
There are no open issues now.,1
Let me reach out and confirm if,0
Let me know if you need more time.,1
We can’t proceed until we get the,0
There’s more to it but I’ll,0
That’s already been taken care of.,1
All the sections are complete.,1
The changes have been deployed.,1
We were close to finishing when,0
The fix is live now.,1
I’ll clean up the document now.,1
They were reviewing it before,0
I'll follow up after this call.,1
Everything looks accurate to me.,1
You could try restarting it if,0
It’s unclear whether they actually,0
They said they’ll reply once they,0
They told me it should be ready but,0
Couldn’t access the dashboard because,0
Unless you think we should,0
"Thanks, I’ve received the update.",1
It’s included in the report.,1
She tried to update it but,0
They’ve been working on that but,0
The details will be clearer once we,0
"After we finish this, we can",0
"Yes, I checked and it’s working.",1
The document is now final.,1
We should have time unless,0
"If that doesn’t work, we’ll",0
It was confusing when she,0
We’re good to go on this task.,1
Just need to validate the last,0
They approved it without any changes.,1
We’ve locked in the date.,1
I already sent the confirmation.,1
The review went smoothly.,1
We can finalize that once the,0
This looks much better than before.,1
I’ll get started on the next task.,1
All files have been uploaded.,1
He joined just a few minutes ago.,1
I think we should verify the,0
I saw your notes—very helpful.,1
Let’s see how it performs after we,0
Let's reconvene after lunch.,1
She's reviewing it now.,1
Let’s revisit this topic if we,0
Can we check on that after we,0
We finalized the notes together.,1
We didn’t realize it was still,0
That concludes my update.,1
We agreed to move forward with it.,1
She didn’t say whether it’s going to,0
"Unless we hear from them, we",0
The files are missing from the,0
The proposal has been accepted.,1
That section needs to be reviewed before we,0
Everything was submitted on time.,1
I'll be offline after 5 today.,1
"Yes, I reviewed that yesterday.",1
Let me approve it right now.,1
He didn’t mention the updated,0
He was about to explain when,0
He might suggest something different if,0
This matches what we discussed.,1
I'll notify everyone on the team.,1
You should see the update live now.,1
This should be easier if we,0
We assumed they had already,0
He gave his feedback earlier.,1
The client has signed the agreement.,1
She said it depends on the,0
Let’s hold off until they,0
It looks ready to publish.,1
I wasn’t expecting it to fail when,0
We could add that in the,0
I’ve completed the checklist.,1
Everyone is aligned on this now.,1
I'm waiting to see if he,0
I’ll add that once I,0
I appreciate your quick response.,1
He couldn’t make it because,0
We’d need more data before we,0
He’s probably waiting on the final,0
I’ll handle that after lunch.,1
No further action is needed from your side.,1
Let me know when you’ve reviewed it.,1
She didn’t say anything after the,0
They flagged an error when trying to,0
You can go ahead and close the issue.,1
Could be related to the last,0
We’ve met all the criteria.,1
The notes have been shared with the group.,1
That timeline still works for us.,1
"Yes, we’ve sent out the invites.",1
We’ll start the next phase tomorrow.,1
She’ll update us once she,0
It was part of the original but now it,0
Not sure whether we can finish before,0
Let’s circle back once we hear from,0
All the metrics look good.,1
The new version resolves the bugs.,1
We tried to validate it but,0
That completes the checklist.,1
I couldn’t get a clear answer when,0
You’ll find all the files in the folder.,1
The system should restart automatically unless,0
We lost access right after they,0
We’ll need their input before we,0
We’ll probably need to create a,0
I haven’t looked into that part yet because,0
It would help if they could also,0
We assumed it was included with the,0
The logs have been archived properly.,1
That depends on how they decide to,0
It looks like we’ve covered all points.,1
They’ve finished the final draft.,1
The issue came up when they tried to,0
We were checking the logs and noticed,0
We’re right on schedule.,1
"Once we adjust that, we can then",0
No major issues were reported.,1
The remaining parts weren’t ready when,0
That’s exactly what we agreed on.,1
This version looks much cleaner.,1
It stopped responding right after we,0
It was strange that the report didn’t,0
I’ll double-check it once I,0
The client has confirmed their approval.,1
He submitted the update a minute ago.,1
I’ve sent the follow-up just now.,1
There might be a conflict with the,0
He mentioned something about the,0
They accepted the proposal without edits.,1
Everything is aligned with the initial plan.,1
It’s already synced with the server.,1
She completed her part early this morning.,1
We should be good to publish now.,1
I think we’ve nailed the final version.,1
They requested changes but didn’t,0
"If nothing else comes up, we can",0
The results were unclear because,0
We might need to reassign this if,0
The checklist has been completed.,1
We’ve integrated all the feedback.,1
I pushed the fix this morning.,1
We didn’t complete the testing for the,0
Everything is in place for the rollout.,1
She handled that part yesterday.,1
We’ll have to reschedule unless they,0
I followed up on your behalf.,1
Let’s document this in the report.,1
I’ve shared the updated link.,1
It depends on how soon we can,0
The workflow seems stable now.,1
We're ready to proceed as planned.,1
They were discussing whether we should,0
Just added the reference to the doc.,1
Let’s keep it open until we,0
The session was very productive.,1
Please confirm once you receive it.,1
The call has been scheduled for Monday.,1
Let’s revisit this after we see the,0
They couldn’t access the platform due to,0
Let me know when we should,0
She might join later if she,0
I haven’t gotten a reply from the,0
It’s been verified and approved.,1
He was preparing the slides but,0
She didn’t confirm whether she’ll be,0
I’m not sure how we’ll handle the,0
Let’s verify that after we test the,0
He was supposed to send that by,0
It’s already on the shared drive.,1
She’s wrapping it up as we speak.,1
I planned to bring it up during the,0
We’ve checked it multiple times.,1
"Thanks, I’ll make a note of that.",1
Let me finalize this and send it over.,1
We’ve captured all relevant points.,1
We can finalize that after we get the,0
That might cause delays if they,0
Everything has been finalized.,1
It’s ready for internal review.,1
We checked compatibility yesterday.,1
I’ll try to check that once,0
He didn’t explain why the,0
Couldn’t locate the source for the,0
Not sure what to do if the,0
"Unless we hear back soon, we",0
The files are backed up properly.,1
I’ve included all the updates.,1
We might get approval if the,0
"Once the review is done, we can",0
He’s wrapping up the last item.,1
They were happy with the changes.,1
You’re all set for the demo.,1
He mentioned something about changing the,0
Let’s proceed with the approved plan.,1
He filled out the form.,1
We sent the invoice last night.,1
The document should’ve included the,0
We lost some progress when,0
I’m still trying to get clarity on the,0
There’s a problem with the last,0
That’s all for today’s agenda.,1
We aligned on all next steps.,1
The file didn’t upload when I,0
It meets all the specifications.,1
"Once we draft it, we should",0
I'll submit this after our call.,1
There’s more to that issue than we,0
Let’s push the changes to staging.,1
The notification has gone out.,1
We’ll start testing tomorrow morning.,1
It’s ready for release.,1
We’ll make the announcement tomorrow.,1
She asked me to remind you to,0
This won’t work unless we first,0
We couldn’t complete it because of the,0
This will depend on what they,0
I completed it just before the meeting.,1
Let me look into that and,0
It’s not working the way we,0
They started the deployment but,0
There’s a note missing in the,0
The report looks good to go.,1
We assumed it was included but,0
This makes sense only if we,0
I'll handle the submission today.,1
We’ll need to address that once we,0
I’ve cross-checked all entries.,1
You didn’t get the email because,0
We approved it after the last check.,1
It’s safe to proceed.,1
"Yes, I’ll finish the slide deck tonight.",1
I haven’t had a chance to,0
Let’s reschedule that once we,0
We submitted the final version.,1
"If we delay this, then the",0
We were about to finalize the,0
We were reviewing the numbers but,0
The site is now functioning correctly.,1
He didn’t send the final email so we,0
"If she’s unavailable, we’ll",0
He left early and didn’t get to,0
They closed the support ticket.,1
He was checking the logs before he,0
Let’s mark this task as done.,1
It might crash if we try to,0
The proposal is now locked.,1
He closed the issue yesterday.,1
It should appear in your inbox.,1
She confirmed her availability.,1
"If they approve it, we can then",0
Not sure whether they already,0
They stopped midway through the,0
I confirmed the details with her.,1
Let me log out and check again.,1
I haven’t added the last part because,0
You can download the results.,1
Let’s review this section again after we,0
No more changes are expected.,1
They said it would be ready after the,0
She handled that section efficiently.,1
She was typing something but then she,0
You might want to follow up if,0
Could be a problem with the,0
It would’ve been easier if we had,0
Let’s document the results today.,1
Let’s review the timeline later.,1
It won’t be clear until we,0
They’ve tested the integration already.,1
We were trying to finalize it before,0
The metrics show improvement.,1
I added the new contacts.,1
He acknowledged the request.,1
Everything has been signed off.,1
That part has already been resolved.,1
"Thanks, I’ll update the list.",1
It's added to the project board.,1
"After the call, we should probably",0
We’ll have to confirm with the,0
I’ll notify the rest of the team.,1
Let’s log off for now.,1
"Before I forget, can we",0
"If that’s true, then maybe we",0
The changes were reviewed yesterday.,1
I think we’re good to close this.,1
He didn’t finish the last part of the,0
There’s a delay in the,0
Let’s double-check it before we,0
It’s working smoothly now.,1
I’ve updated the permissions.,1
He’ll submit the form today.,1
I asked him about it but he,0
I was thinking about asking them if,0
He stopped updating the doc after,0
He was preparing the summary but,0
We had a good discussion.,1
The chart was incomplete because,0
He finished the revisions.,1
I was supposed to call him after the,0
We need to look at the data again if,0
She told me about the,0
We’ll need to revisit that after we,0
Nothing else is pending today.,1
They confirmed attendance.,1
She verified the results this morning.,1
It’s confirmed for Friday.,1
It seemed fine until,0
You could ask her about the,0
They accepted the invite already.,1
I’ve just posted the update.,1
They were going to mention it during the,0
Let me know if they,0
They didn’t finalize the design since,0
I'll resend it once I,0
Let’s check again after the,0
They have all the access they need.,1
I’ve pushed the update.,1
She uploaded the files just now.,1
You can close the tab now.,1
This version looks finalized.,1
I meant to bring it up during the,0
He signed off last night.,1
I was about to finish that when,0
The tool didn’t load after I,0
The setup process is complete.,1
They received the brief.,1
We weren’t sure whether it would,0
Please check the final version.,1
That wraps up our session.,1
That depends on how soon we,0
I’ve checked the email thread.,1
It might not work unless we,0
Couldn’t submit it because the,0
She was reviewing the data when,0
Let me share the document now.,1
Let’s finalize the notes now.,1
There’s still something missing in the,0
"If we adjust the timing, then we might",0
We’re ready to wrap this up.,1
You’re all set now.,1
She didn’t provide the details so we,0
They resolved the issue quickly.,1
We didn’t confirm the exact,0
Everything looks fine from here.,1
It was almost done but,0
He asked about it earlier but we,0
Could be a timing issue if we,0
I was going to include that in the,0
It’s been moved to the archive.,1
Let’s proceed with the next item.,1
We sent the feedback earlier.,1
We're right on track with our goals.,1
I’ve archived the old files.,1
"Once we verify the numbers, we can",0
She tried to explain but then she,0
It’s properly formatted now.,1
We reached a consensus.,1
Everything has been backed up.,1
No additional input is needed.,1
"Unless they respond, we can't",0
Not clear if they’ll,0
We couldn’t access it when,0
The tests passed successfully.,1
That sounds good to me.,1
We’ve completed the changes.,1
There might be a conflict if we,0
That’s what I thought until we,0
The review is finished.,1
We were in the middle of the,0
Let’s wait to hear back before we,0
We covered all the topics.,1
That’s everything from our side.,1
All the fields have been completed.,1
Let’s move forward as discussed.,1
"Once that’s done, I’ll",0
We’re done on our end.,1
They shared the report this morning.,1
All dependencies are resolved.,1
We’re locked in for next Tuesday.,1
There might be delays depending on the,0
"Once the test completes, we can",0
Let’s try again after checking the,0
I'll draft a follow-up email.,1
"If it keeps crashing, we’ll have to",0
I’ll handle the task assignment.,1
They stopped working on it after,0
They had trouble loading the,0
I updated the spreadsheet accordingly.,1
They need to confirm before we,0
She approved the updates yesterday.,1
The first version was rejected due to,0
We may need to revisit the question of,0
I verified the test results.,1
It’s scheduled for next week.,1
The latest version didn’t include the,0
"Unless something changes, we won’t",0
I just reviewed your message.,1
We didn’t plan for that scenario where,0
Let’s wait until we get the updated,0
She’s working on the final edits.,1
We cleaned up the formatting.,1
"Before we start, we should probably",0
We weren’t able to finish it because,0
He left a comment about the,0
Everything is now connected.,1
He finished reviewing the proposal.,1
That aligns with what we expected.,1
It seemed like a good idea until,0
She completed the onboarding steps.,1
The task has been reassigned.,1
I shared the files with the team.,1
He confirmed it verbally.,1
Let’s keep things moving forward.,1
The results are in and look good.,1
We're aligned on the approach.,1
