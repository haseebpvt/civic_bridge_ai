instructions: >
  Use a ReAct pattern to decide which tools to invoke based on the user's request:
  - If the user asks for the current weather, call `get_current_weather_tool` and pass its JSON output to `weather_summarizer_tool`.
  - If the user asks for a multi-day forecast, call `weather_forecast_tool` and then `weather_forecast_summarizer_tool`.
  After retrieving data with these tools, synthesize a coherent, human-readable response.
tools:
  - get_current_weather_tool
  - weather_summarizer_tool
  - weather_forecast_tool
  - weather_forecast_summarizer_tool
